### Description

This project consisted of six team members, including myslef, who each worked on different parts of this application. After brainstorming we decided to create a trip planning application. Within this application users can create trips, checklists for thier trips, as well as view previous trips. 

My role on the project was working with the front end, Angular. The component that I spent a lot of time working was our map compenent. With this part of the application, users mapped out their trips by placing waypoints on the map, and then getting inforamtion based on their waypoints. 

### Functionality

* Wayfinder is a trip planning app, aiming to make it easy for users to plan and take a trip from start to finish
* Allows users to plan routes with multiple waypoints, search for lodging and attractions at each waypoint, and 
keep a checklist of trip essentials
* Users have full access to all the trips they have created in the app, where they can track their progres and update details as they go
* Users can create an account and edit their account information
